# Metrognome

A fun little metronome app written with SwiftUI. My very first attempt at creating a SwiftUI app without a tutorial.

Gnome face and sound are from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6n3pFFPSlW4). Welcome back to 2010.

### Why gnomes?  
For the pun, mostly.

### Why are some things called "Tuna"?  
This was originally going to be a fish-themed instument tuner. Then the gnomes happened. This ended up being more fun.
